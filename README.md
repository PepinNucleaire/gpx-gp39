It features :

- Easy upload of GPX

2. It downloads your file with a good name
3. Put the dowloaded file on your USB key formatted in Fat32
4. Import it via I/O menu

## Troubleshooting

- The first click on upload is buggy, the second one should work
- Make sure that the downloaded gpx file is a gpx file inside

### Requirements
